# mit-sloan-2019
Optional Information for my application to the MIT Sloan MBA class of 2019.

## Background
I chose to make a website because I thought it would be a good opportunity to showcase my web development skills and is a creative medium to explain my message.

## Technology
I started with a template from https://startbootstrap.com to save some time. Other libraries and technologies used:
- Bootstrap
- Fontawesome
- Google Fonts
- Jquery

## Hosting
The website is hosted as a static website using Amazon S3. 

## Fallback
The file error.pdf contains a PDF version of the website as an alternative way to view the content in the event of errors or issues with s3.
